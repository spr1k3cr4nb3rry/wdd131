			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
				The purpose of this site is to be a portfolio showcasing my work as an illustrator and graphic designer,
				as well as providing information about my services and how to contact me. I could also include a section
				about my web design services and link to this site as an example of my skills for potential clients.
			</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
				My target audience includes potential clients looking for illustration and graphic design services,
				art enthusiasts interested in my work, and fellow creatives seeking inspiration or collaboration.
			</p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
				JavaScript will be used to create 1) an interactive gallery where users can filter artwork by category,
				as well as 2) a contact form that provides real-time validation feedback to users as they fill it out.
				I could also potentially include 3) a blog section that dynamically loads posts without refreshing the page.

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>

			<h3>Navigation</h3>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>HOME PAGE</h3>
				<p>
					This page will be the landing page for my portfolio site. It will feature a showcase of my latest works,
					and when you scroll more will load. There will be a small introduction paragraph, and the footer will have links
					to my social media and contact information.

					<br><br>When you hover over any image, it will display the title of the piece, some tags, and a short description.
					Clicking on the image will take you to a separate page with more details about the piece, including the tools used,
					the inspiration behind it, and a larger view of the artwork.

					<br><br>There will also be a filtering option at the top of the gallery to sort artwork by categories such as "Illustrations," "Graphic Design," and "Personal Projects."
				</p>
			<h3>ABOUT PAGE</h3>
				<p>
					This page will provide information about me as an artist and designer. It will include a short biography,
					some stuff about my artistic journey, and my design philosophy. There will also be a section highlighting my skills,
					tools I use, and any notable achievements or exhibitions.
				
					<br><br>There will be a picture of myself to the left, and below the paragraphs will be a small illustration I made that represents my artistic style. There will also be buttons that link to my social medias and email.

					<br><br>I could also add a section that lets you write a message to me and send it directly through the site. This contact form will have real-time validation to ensure all fields are filled out correctly before submission. Maybe including a kind-of callback
					email that confirms receipt of the message would be a nice touch?

					<br><br>The footer will be consistent with the home page, containing links to my social media and contact information.
				</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>HOME PAGE</h3>
			<p>
				When the home page is open, the HOME button in the header will be light blue to indicate the current page.
				<br>When you hover over any image in the gallery, it will gain a pink overlay and display the title of the piece, some tags, and a short description;
			</p>
			<img src="images/home_wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>
				ABOUT PAGE
			</h3>
			<p>
				When the about page is open, the ABOUT button in the header will be light blue to indicate the current page.
			</p>
			<img src="images/about_wireframe.png" alt="page 2 wireframe" />
